Welcome to the Green Lantern Logo project!

This is a single HTML page that uses HTML5 and Canvas (plus help from jQuery!) to produce configurable images that can be saved as wallpaper for iPhone, iPad or PC. As of Summer 2014, Google Chrome will save the image as a JPEG (right-click, "Save As...") - other platforms may (hopefully) will support this going forward.
